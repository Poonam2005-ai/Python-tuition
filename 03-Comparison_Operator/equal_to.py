# eual to operator 
# if the output of the left and right side is same then it gives us True value otherwise it gives false value.

#print(10 == 10) # True  --> for understanding 
#print(5 == 10) # False 

#---------------------------------------------
#Python is case sensitive language because of that of we capare small case String with upper case then it gives us False value. 
# print("hello" == "Hello") # False

# ex 3 
a = 20 
b = 40
# print(a == b) # False

# real time example
#Checking if the entered pass matches the stored pass

stored_pass = "Divyanka0811"  # Pass during registration
entered_pass = "divyanka0811"  # false #pass during login the page 
entered_pass = "Divyanka0811" # True

print(entered_pass == stored_pass) 

# VIMP -> if we initialized a variable with a value and again re-initialized it by another value then it returns the value which we stored at the last time
